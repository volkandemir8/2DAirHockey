# 2D Air Hockey with Unity ML-Agents

This project is a 2D Air Hockey game developed in Unity, featuring multiple types of opponents powered by different AI techniques.

## Features
- Play the game yourself by controlling the paddle.
- Classic AI Opponent: A manually coded, rule-based opponent with deterministic behavior.
- ML-Agents Opponents: Trained using Unity ML-Agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).
- AI vs AI Matches: Let ML-Agents opponents compete against each other or against the classic AI.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to analyze and compare different AI approaches. It allows observing how a rule-based opponent performs compared to reinforcement learning agents, and how PPO and SAC differ in terms of learning strategies and gameplay behavior.
